# digit-recognition

An implementation of a neural net classifier and a framework for interacting with digit recognition models. 
This application allows you to draw digits within a window and make predictions using your model. The default model is a 
2 hidden layer neural network classifier with 300 hidden units for each layer. Press space-bar to clear the window and 
display your model's prediction. Theory behind the implementation is provided in theory.pdf
