# digit-recognition

An implementation of a neural net classifier from scratch and a framework for interacting with models that are trained to recognize hand-written digits. This application allows you to draw digits within a window and make predictions using your model. The default model is a 2 hidden layer neural network classifier with 300 hidden units for each layer. Press space-bar to clear the window and display your model's prediction.

Note: the rough mathematics for the "from-scratch" implementation is in theory.pdf
